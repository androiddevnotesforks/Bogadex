# Contributing to Bogadex

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

Bogadex is an open-source tool to browse and manage board games. Whether you're fixing a bug, suggesting a feature, or just improving the documentation, your help is appreciated.

This guide outlines how to contribute in a way that aligns with the project's standards.

## 🧱 Code Standards

### 1. Use Conventional Commits

We follow the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

**Example:**

feat: add sorting to game list
fix: handle empty game title gracefully
chore: migrate to ESLint


**Common prefixes:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or fixing tests
- `chore`: Miscellaneous changes like config, tooling, or dependencies

### 2. Keep PRs Focused

Try to keep pull requests focused on a single issue or topic. Smaller, well-scoped changes are easier to review and merge.

## 📦 Maintainers & Workflow

All contributions go through **pull requests**. A maintainer (currently [@jforatier](https://github.com/jforatier)) will review and merge your PR once it's ready.

If you’re unsure about something, feel free to open a **draft PR** or create an **issue** to discuss it first.
